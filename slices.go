// Slices are a key data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays
/**
Unlike arrays, slices are typed only by the elements they contain (not the number of elements). To create an empty slice with non-zero length, use the builtin make. Here we make a slice of strings of length 3 (initially zero-valued)
We can set and get just like with arrays
len returns the length of the slice as expected
